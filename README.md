# Omnichannel-Sales-Pipeline-Orchestration
The objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end data pipeline that merges Shopify e-commerce sales data with Walmart in-store sales data into a unified PostgreSQL data warehouse. Raw transactional records will be transformed into a structured schema suitable for analytics.
