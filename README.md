# Retail Omnichannel Sales Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline solution for a mid-sized retailer, aiming to unify its **online (Shopify)** and **in-store (Walmart)** sales data. The goal is to provide a single source of truth for all sales metrics, enabling data-driven decisions on inventory, pricing, and marketing strategies.

The pipeline is built on a modern data stack, leveraging **Snowflake** for data warehousing, **dbt Core** for data transformation and modeling, and **Google Looker Studio** for interactive visualization.

## Business Case

Operating across multiple sales channels presents a major challenge in data fragmentation. This project addresses this by:  

- **Tracking Revenue Across Channels**: Comparing online vs. in-store performance in real time.  
- **Identifying Best-Selling Products**: Determining top products overall and by channel to optimize inventory stocking.  
- **Reducing Operational Inefficiencies**: Eliminating manual reconciliation of separate reports, saving time, and reducing errors.  
- **Unifying Disparate Data Sources**: Integrating Shopify e-commerce and Walmart in-store data into a centralized data warehouse.

## Data Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline follows a standard Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) workflow:

1. **Extract & Load**: Raw sales data from Walmart (CSV) and Shopify (JSON) is ingested daily and loaded into staging tables in Snowflake.  
2. **Transform & Model (dbt Core)**: dbt is used to clean, standardize, and transform the raw data. The core of this layer is a **star schema** model that includes a `fact_sales` table and dimension tables (`dim_products`, `dim_stores`, `dim_dates`).  
3. **Visualization (Google Looker Studio)**: The cleaned and modeled data is connected to Google Looker Studio to create an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders.

## Conclusions & Future Steps

The implemented data pipeline successfully unifies sales data from disparate sources, providing a clear, holistic view of business performance. Key insights include the dominance of Electronics sales and the abrupt decline in Walmart performance in late 2024.  

Future steps could include:  

- **Granular Analysis**: Investigate the cause of the revenue drop in Walmart by analyzing the data by store location or product category.  
- **Demand Forecasting**: Utilize `forecasted_demand` and `actual_demand` columns to build more accurate predictive models for inventory management.  
- **Marketing Campaign Analysis**: Combine sales data with marketing spend to measure ROI across channels.
